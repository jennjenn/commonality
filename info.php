<h3>what's this all about?</h3>
<p>This system is a part of a semester-long independent study in <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu">information science</a> that I'm conducting under Dan Cosley at <a href="http://cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. My project focuses on engagement trends surrounding the tagging and annotation of cultural artifact items, particularly photos. Data and photos are collected from the <a href="http://flickr.com/commons">Flickr Commons</a> accessed via the Flickr API.</p>
<h3>who are you?</h3>
<p>I'm <a href="http://jennvargas.com">Jennifer Vargas</a>, a graduating senior in Information Science at Cornell University focusing on social systems and human-centered systems. I just finished up my term as Photography Editor of <a href="http://cornellsun.com">The Cornell Daily Sun</a> and have become particularly interested in the fate of the analog photos collecting dust in the drawers and basements of museums, libraries, and news organizations everywhere.</p>
<h3>what happens with the tags I add to a photo?</h3>
<p>Your tag choices are currently stored in a private database. Though it might be a possibility in a future iteration of this system, right now your tags are not added to the photos on the flickr site.</p>
<h3>will you be storing any data about me?</h3>
<p>I won't be storing any personal data except for what you volunteer in the survey. </p>
<h3>how can I contact you?</h3>
<p>email is the best method: jenn {at} jennvargas {dot} com</p>
<h3>credit where credit is due:</h3>
<p>thanks to Dan Cosley for his help with this project, especially the recommended tags. also thanks to <a href="http://famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/">FAMFAMFAM</a> for icons. all photos listed under "no known copyright restrictions".</p>
