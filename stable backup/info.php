	<h3>what's this all about?</h3>
	<p>This system is a part of a semester-long independent study in <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu">information science</a> that I'm conducting under Dan Cosley at <a href="http://cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. My project focuses on engagement trends surrounding the tagging and annotation of cultural artifact items, particularly photos. Data and photos are collected from the <a href="http://flickr.com/commons">Flickr Commons</a> accessed via the Flickr API.</p>
	<h3>who are you?</h3>
	<p>I'm <a href="http://jennvargas.com">Jennifer Vargas</a>, a graduating senior in Information Science at Cornell University focusing on social systems and human-centered systems. I just finished up my term as Photography Editor of <a href="http://cornellsun.com">The Cornell Daily Sun</a> and have become particularly interested in the fate of the analog photos collecting dust in the drawers and basements of museums, libraries, and news organizations everywhere.
